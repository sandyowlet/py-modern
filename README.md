## Overview

For developers unfamiliar with modern project standards, setting up a Python project that adheres to best practices can be challenging. This is especially true when it comes to correctly configuring the `pyproject.toml` file or establishing a CI/CD pipeline, which often requires significant effort.

`pymodern` aims to provide a modern Python project template that optionally includes support for documentation, code formatting, testing, packaging, publishing, and deployment.

## Features

- Manage project dependencies with `uv`.
- Format code using `ruff`.
- Perform type checking with `pyright`.
- Run tests with `pytest`.
- Measure test coverage with `coverage`.
- Build CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Publish projects to PyPI.
- Create documentation with `mkdocs`.
- Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages.
- Ensure code quality on commit with `pre-commit`.
- Execute build and matrix testing workflows with `justfile`.
- Utilize GitHub issue templates.
